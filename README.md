# pyskill

The goal is to test QA-relevant Python 3 skills of an applicant to a SDET position.

> Please note that workfile.py in current master contains just passable solutions, not the exact snippet expected!  

### Suggested procedure
1. The applicant get a laptop with the IDE and environment already set up.
2. They check out a git branch containing cleaned up workfile.py (has all the tasks described), test_skills.py (to be run via pytest) and a few files to read from.
3. The applicant has an hour to write, debug and test all five snippets.
4. The applicant can access any online reference they would like.
5. The interviewer is supposed to watch the applicant writing the solution â€” to gauge the actual skill level. 


### What's being tested
* Python skill: basics, file IO, string formatting, functions, Classes, dicts, JSON, sorting, map/filter/comprehensions.
* Non-core modules: pytest, requests, selenium. The applicant is supposed to know how to run tests and also how to use markers with pytest -m (and verbose output with pytest -s)
* Git knowledge: checking out, branching, creating a pull request (dated and signed with their name).
